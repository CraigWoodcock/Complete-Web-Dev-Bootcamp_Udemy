# Complete Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course

## Overview

This project follows along with a Udemy course on Web Development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React and others.

Although I have experience with HTML and CSS, I have never documented any of my work and so I will be completing sections that I am already familiar with in order to document them properly.

Each section will contain a index.html file which is where my work will be found. There will also be a solution.html which shows the instructors solution along with a goal.png to illustrate the instructors solution.

## What it HTML?

HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language is what we use to define what will be on our web page and in what order they should be displayed in our browser.


## Heading Elements `<h></h>`

Heading Elements are used to turn text into headers. there are 6 header tags `<h1></h1> - <h6></h6>` and should be used to indicate different header sizes/importance throughout our web page. 

The `<h1></h1>` element defines the main page header and there should only be 1 in each html file.

### Header Challenge!
Assign header tags to create a book contents page.
