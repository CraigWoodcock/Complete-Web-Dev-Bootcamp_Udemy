# Complete Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course

## Overview

This project follows along with a Udemy course on Web Development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React and others.

Although I have experience with HTML and CSS, I have never documented any of my work and so I will be completing sections that I am already familiar with in order to document them properly.

Each section will contain a index.html file which is where my work will be found. There will also be a solution.html which shows the instructors solution along with a goal.png to illustrate the instructors solution.

## HTML

What is HTML?

HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language is what we use to define what will be on our web page and in what order they should be displayed in our browser.


### Heading Elements `<h></h>`

Heading Elements are used to turn text into headers. there are 6 header tags `<h1></h1> - <h6></h6>` and should be used to indicate different header sizes/importance throughout our web page. 

The `<h1></h1>` element defines the main page header and there should only be 1 in each html file.

#### Header Challenge!
Assign header tags to create a book contents page.
#### [Heading Element Code](<Heading_Element>)


### Paragraph Elements `<p></p>`

The paragraph element `<p></p>` is used to seperate paragraphs of text and uses an open and close tag.

#### Paragrah Challenge!

Assign paragraph tags to the text in order to render paragraphs in the browser.

#### [Paragraph Element Code](Paragraph_Element)


### Void Elements (Self-Closing Tags)

There are a number of elements that are self closing and so do not require a closing tag at the end.

an example of these are:

`<br>` - Line break
`<hr>` - Horizontal Rule (draws a horizontal line across the page).

They are known as 'void elements' because they essentially create a 'void' on the screen to separate text.

#### Void Element challenge!

Format the document to match the instructors example. It should contain h1, P, br and an hr at minimum.

#### [Void element Code](Void_Elements)

### Movie Ranking Project

Replicate the instructors Movie ranking webpage. Adding 3 Movies of My Choice.

I added a simple css stylesheet to change background color, align text to centre and make the hr black

### List Elements

List elements provide us with a list style formatting. we can have a bullet point style list or a numbered list:

ul = unordered list (bullet points)
ol = ordered list (numbers)

#### List Element Challenge

format the document to match the instructors solution. Use `ul` and `ol` to create a recipe page.

I also added a css stylesheet with some basic css formatting.

### Birthday Party Invite Project

In this project I was tasked with creating a birthday party invite incorporating an image, ordered list, unordered list and a link to google maps.

### Webpages

what is a webpage? Well, a website is made up of a collection of files(usually html) that link to each other using anchor tags. For example we might have a home web page (or homepage) that has an 'About Me' Link. When clicked, this link will take the user to another webpage that contains information about me. The 'About me' page might then have a link to the homepage. This is essentially what webpages are. Each separate page on the website has it's own file.

In this section i will be creating a basic website with a homepage, an 'about me' section that can be accessed by clicking on my profile picture and a 'contact me' link that takes the user to contact information.

### Personal Portfolio Project

Here I will be creating a personal portfolio website using only html. It will be a multi-site webpage with links to individual projects, about me page and contact details page.
