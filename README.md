# Complete Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course

## Overview

This project follows along with a Udemy course on Web Development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React and others.

Although I have experience with HTML and CSS, I have never documented any of my work and so I will be completing sections that I am already familiar with in order to document them properly.

Each section will contain a index.html file which is where my work will be found. There will also be a solution.html which shows the instructors solution along with a goal.png to illustrate the instructors solution.
